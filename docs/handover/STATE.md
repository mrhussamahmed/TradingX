## Pending items

- Phase 0 is complete and pushed to `origin/main`.
- `SPEC-0001` is active at `specs/001-paper-trading-bot/spec.md`.
- `PLAN-0001` is active at `specs/001-paper-trading-bot/plan.md`.
- `TASKS-0001` is active at `specs/001-paper-trading-bot/tasks.md`.
- `ADR-0009` selects Nautilus Trader as the backtest engine.
- `GATES-0001` defines the Stage 1 gate evidence baseline.
- `TASKS-0001` implementation is complete and merged into `main`.
- `codex/paper-service-upgrades` has been merged into `main`.
- The current repository now provides:
  - a deterministic paper trading loop with recovery and auditable risk
    decisions
  - a recurring paper-service runtime that scans a bounded symbol
    universe and persists service-cycle summaries
  - deterministic exit logic for existing positions via take-profit and
    stop-loss thresholds
  - an offline mandatory-candidate evaluation pipeline with persisted
    evidence packs
  - richer operator alerts, including optional Telegram and SMTP
    delivery and evidence-report summaries for paper-service runs
- Validation is green on `main`; `./scripts/validate` passed with the
  expected closed-market smoke skip.
- Next artifact step is to run the paper service during regular US
  market hours, verify real Telegram/SMTP delivery if desired, and begin
  collecting the longer-lived evidence required for Gates 1 through 3.
